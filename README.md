# Generative Squares
This is a project to familiarize myself with how one might approach creating generative art with randomized scaled vector graphics made with JavaScript.

It is a simple app made with HTML, CSS, and JS. No frameworks or libraries, but in the future, some projects may require the use of P5.js or D3.js.

Each time the page loads it creates a random number of randomly sized and colored rectangles, laid out on an svg container.
